## üåü Usage Guide

### Adding an Expense
1. **Fill out the form fields:**
   - **Name:** Enter the name of the expense (e.g., "Groceries").
   - **Category:** Choose or enter a category (e.g., Food, Travel, Entertainment).
   - **Price:** Enter the amount (must be a  number, e.g., 50).

2. **Click the Add button** to save the expense. The data will be validated using **Zod**:
   - If the input is **invalid**, a **React Hot Toast** error message will be displayed.
   - If the input is **valid**, the expense will be saved to **local storage** and displayed in the table.

### Viewing Expenses
All added expenses are displayed in a table with the following columns:

- **Name:** The name of the expense.
- **Category:** The category of the expense.
- **Price:** The amount of the expense.
- **Actions:** A delete button (üóëÔ∏è) to remove the expense.

### Searching Expenses
Use the **search input** at the top of the table to filter expenses by category.

- The search is **debounced**, meaning it will only trigger after you stop typing for **300ms**, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Example:** Type "Food" in the search bar to display only expenses in the "Food" category.

### Deleting an Expense
- Click the **Delete button** (üóëÔ∏è) next to an expense to remove it from the list and local storage.
- A **React Hot Toast** notification will confirm the deletion.
